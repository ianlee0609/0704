      "having watched the first season, it looks great! yes, the cgi/practical model mix is odd, but considering puppets and models were used in the 60's to tell vast epic stories in a way that budgets would not allow, this feels like an evolution of that idea. the model work is equally great. however, the show itself fails to capture (imo) what made the original so unique. that being, the idea that it is a kids show disguised as an adult show with interesting rescues and professional dedication of the main characters (that were also interesting) devoid of guns and traditional action. this feels a bit too much like a kids show and this group is just a bit too reckless and 'bro' like and the rescues (when they do actually show them) are lazily written and boring. instead the show concentrates on other types of traditional action, which is baffling to me. not to mention the stories feel rushed (in the wrong way) in the current half hour format. still, considering the original was cancelled after a season and a half, perhaps securing ratings is their first goal? at least i can hope. as it is worlds better than the live action film from 2004, i'll stick with it and support it in the hopes it manages to figure out what it wants to be, hopefully embracing some of the original elements that made it so interesting in the first place.\n",

      "this will help those folks that have pointed out the inception similarities. doctor strange is a mind-bending, psychedelic, and dark comic series. he is a practitioner of a mystic art form in which they can travel thru the very fabric of time and space. he can snap his fingers and transport the avengers to another dimension. he's like the bulk beings in interstellar. he can live and manipulate beyond the four dimensions we know. with powers like that, it would make him crucial for infinity war. that \"inception\" scene that you are referencing to is not the same as it was in inception. it was quite different,  just like it was in upside down. the visuals may be similar, but it's how i would expect a live action adaptation to look like. as much as i loved inception, it wasn't all that original. it borrowed from the thirteenth floor, the dark city, the matrix, videodrome, existenz, and paprika. a similar scene was in an earlier draft of x-men: first class, but the script was rewritten due to inception's trailer being released. in a sense, all the mentioned films above were influenced by doctor strange comics, which have been around since 1963.\n",

      "snyder did what most directors wouldn't dare to do - try to surprise both fans of superman and those of batman. instead of making a copy of marvel's formula(which is super-dull and kid-friendly)he went the opposite way giving the chance to show that dc fans are a more mature audience.\n",

      "then academy must include at least 1 mexican actor, an asian, a muslim and a handicapped.... ridiculous childish loser, in the very first place this dude is racist against whites, second: you get nominated because you did a great performance, not because you're white, black or green\n",
      "spike lee is a racist and incites racial hatred. just look at the zimmerman case. aside from that he hasn't made a decent film in years. the academy definitely could use a wake up call as it is run by old white jewish men, but the diversity campaign should not be run by a man who hates interracial relationships (look it up).\n",
      "tl dr : spike lee is a xenophobic, close minded shit who should not be in the public eye.\n",
      "this is an issue that is complicated and difficult to encapsulate beyond the soundbites. while i think the african american community (or any other minority community for that matter) have the right to point out the very uneven representation they have in academy, i believe the reaction to this year's nominations may have been a bit too heavy handed. if nothing else, rather than pointing the finger at the people voting whithin the academy, the critical look should be made at the producers of said films, who by and large make decisions to cast (and typecast) actors and hire directors of a certain race for their movies. if they had more willingness to take chance on minority actors/directors, there would be a lot more diverse product for which the academy could vote and things wouldl get further normalized. also to take into consideration is that over 40% of the population in the u.s. is caucasian, while african americans represent 19%, so we also have to account to the fact of demographics. heck, you could make the argument hispanics and asian should be even more outraged as their representation is even lower. it is a shame in the end, as i think constant overrreaction will dilute a very valid message to ponder on. i don't believe this was the year to make such statements. let's keep in mind that actors of african descent won oscars in the last two versions of the awards, and two hispanics won best director. one year does not a trend make.\n",
      "even if the number of nominees was expanded from 5 to 20 in each category, spike lee wouldn't be nominated.\n",
      "i wonder about the \"value\" of the next oscars that go out to black actors and actresses. \n",
      "\n",
      "it sounds like the director of the academy is doing her best to balance out the representation of voting black academy members.\n",
      "\n",
      " all i can think is that there is going to be a major over-correction among members feeling the need to nominate blacks, leading to the best picture oscar  going to \"norbert 2, electric boogaloo\", and other oscars being passed out with more regard to the color of the skin than the content of the character (so to speak).\n",
      "i wouldn't complain about the academy. it is not them writing and making movies. if \"black\" movies tend to be either hilariously stupid (remember the \"did you see white chicks?\" - joke?) or telling the same ghetto-story over and over again, then it is the fault of the writers, the directors and the producers and not the academy. and why did spike lee do inside man, which actually was his last good movie? where are the black actors in that movie? if there is a tendency of creating stupid roles for black actors, you shouldn't complain about getting no rewards, but you should complain about not getting quality movies made in the first place.\n",
      "spike lee is such a fucking joke. hasn't made a watchable film in decades (clockers or he got game were the last decent ones i remember) and \"moral stance\" - lol - look at the man, what a fucking whore - he's a walking talking advertisement. \n",
      "\n",
      "i also love how this rich racist asshole is all about blacks - until he needs numbers, he moves to \"people of color\" ie other non whites.\n",
      "\n",
      "i support diversity...wait no, i support the stopping of exclusion based on nonsense like race. but spike lee is a racist, hate monger, sell out, hypocrite and as far as i'm concerned he can go fuck himself.  he went from race issues to the race card when his talent ran out.\n",
      "i understand why the black actors are upset but i think their argument about no blacks being nominated is not that serious. it sucks that black people and other minorities barley get any recognition for their work but to be fair it's not the oscars' fault they aren't getting nominated, it's hollywood's fault for not being diverse in films. these black celebrities trying to boycott the oscars' are a joke, some of them complaining hasn't even done a film in years and the last thing we need is black people ranting yelling \"black actors matter\" lol. spike lee said recently he is excited that the oscars' committee is looking to get a more diverse group of people to pick nominees and vote, spike lee said that is an accomplishment, which it isn't. if there is one thing i hate it's forced diversity, i hate when a film, tv series, or hollywood event forces diversity because of complaints, i love diverse casts when it's natural selected groups and not an affirmative action decision because they feel bad. as i said i'm all for diversity but it's not an accomplishment when blacks had to force the oscars' committee to be more diverse, because guaranteed most of the next black people to be nominated for an oscar will be an affirmative action selection, so prepare to see \"decent\" performances by black actors/actresses to get nominated for now on. we'll probably see kevin hart nominated for ride along 2 lol. also, it's not just our people getting snubbed for oscars', you rarely ever see a hispanic or asian nominated, which is even more sad. i would support their boycott if they did this years ago when black people didn't get nominated or that one year when no minorities were nominated by robert downey jr got nominated for his role in tropic thunder when he posed as black and asian male, that nomination is a slap in the face to minorities actors but did they complain no. spike lee & will smith just bitching cause they didn't get a nominaton for their crap work in 2015. spike lee's chi raq was trash and concussion was so horrible it gave me a concussion now they expect to be nominated because of their race. as i said i'm all for more  diversity but don't try to force people to make things more diverse. in reality spike and all the other black celebrities ranting need to be more humble, ice cube didn't get a nomination for straight outta compton and he's fine with it. the academy usually nominates those real boring movies that no one has never heard of or seen a trailer for but ever year theirs like those 2-3 movies people actually heard of that gets nominated, moral of saying that straight outta compton was too mainstream, exciting and popular for the oscars. also i just want to say white people prove spike lee's point more when the only film you can mention is 12 years a slave, as i said i disagree with spike but if 12 years a slave is the only film made by a black man with a black male & woman as the leads that won/was nominated then that's a problem.\n",

      "your answer would most likely be, that the opportunity is there for them too, they just have to be good enough to be drafted.\n",
      "\n",
      "the same is true for oscars. the opportunities are there for all actors and actresses, regardless of skin colour. you just have to act accordingly in a movie to be nominated. that's all.\n",
      "\n",
      "but playing the \"racism card\" because of being greedy (even if you don't admit it) is the most disgusting and dishonorable act you can do.\n",
      "i get what he's doing but they're not all bad. he did get an honarary academy award at a relatively young age (remembering that most recipients are in their mid 70s to 80s and he was in his late 50s).\n",
      "an oscar boycott....ya know .....how can i put this into context, i respect will and jada and others for how they feel. i honestly believe will should have been nominated for concussion as well. but on a keeping it real stand point, this is nothing new. i'm not saying that a boycott is foolish, but what i'm saying is that i don't believe it will solve anything but just propaganda and in-closet racist people making a joke of it at the academy awards this year. i'm not saying that because i want to be part of the problem, and when i speak this i'm trying to reach out to every, already or aspiring black filmmaker, actor, and producer out there. black people let's peep black hollywood history, it speaks for itself. right now a high paid black filmmaker and very well high paid black actor and actress believe that the answer to a generated world wide problem is boycotting an industry that has for generations, made money off of separatism, negative racial propaganda...ie black face for the new millennium. like i said nothing new, which is why i say, nothing wrong with a boycott. however, if we really want to solve the problem....focus less on reparation, if you want to emulate the past, then we as black people need to seriously understand that racism starts at home. we as black filmmakers need to (not just talk) but start our own black oscars, start building our own black film studios, give these young black talents out here in the world an opportunity to be the next steve mcqueen, spike lee, jamie foxx, sidney poitier, antoine fuqua, will smith... these high paid names that we love and respect.... it starts with them. kathleen cleaver once said that \" when the black panther party put together there 10 point program, the point was not to show what the government was not doing, the point was to show how the community could empower itself and how the community could organize.\" it starts at home brothers and sisters, and this should not be a black problem because it hits home on a once a year basis. its very simple the established black faces out there need to seek out and nurture the young black filmmakers, actors, actresses and teach them how to sharpen and hone their untapped talent and turn that into the brilliant, provocative future films of tomorrow. it's time to stand up and show that we as a people are more than our physical attributes and stereotypical bs images that they perpetuate us as and we continue to buy into. real established black production companies i believe will break down the barriers and give way to the silent voices that have long since deserved their own recognized academy awards. that is a true revolution against a vanguard establishment like hollywood.\n",

      "kevin t conlon and i saw this last night. probably not for everyone (check: how many tarantino films have you seen; and, do you need to see redemption? are 2 questions you should ask yourself) but i think that this is the best film tarantino has ever made. last night i was reminded of my, my family's and the audience reactions to the first viewing of \"pulp fiction\".\n",
      "lot's of dialogue, over-the-top violence (albeit short-lived), and yeah, there was a \"twist\" but it wasn't like..  omg!!!  definitely not one of his better works.  i do typically enjoy tarantino flicks, i couldn't wait for the credits to roll on this one...  i was just kind of bored with it.\n",

      "basically, the movie could have been better if it were shorter, more focused and linear... in other words, if he had made the regular old school western leone/peckinpah style, it would have been a much better movie... this way, it's just an unsuccessful postmodern exercise in western genre... i believe that both the revenant and bone tomahawk are superior movies (y)\n",

      "on christmas day 2015 quentin tarantino debuted his 8th film the hateful eight\n",
      "a not so interesting story of 8 characters sharing a cabing in the blizzard coverd mountains of wyoming set around the 1800's, in the film an allstar cast (tarantinos ususlals) portray as bounty hunters, outlaws cowboys and shady confederates. seting up a film filled with twists revealing plot holes and gun shots alltemetlly ending in a very tarantino like trademark ending.\n",
      "this film is evidentley very poor in dialogue and predictable in every way, you know all the people in the cabing are gonna die, you know that the angle of the story is going to change to give it that tarantino film like feel to it and yes after the character set up is made and everybody feels confortable enaugh everybody is treated to gorey gunshots scenes.\n",
      "the film relies heavelly on samuel l jacksons and kurt russel's performances, now dont get me wrong they do their part like allways in tarantinos movies but that's just it they at no time convince you they are bounty hunters set in those times this makes bouth them and the secondary characters seem very uninteresting do to the fact that you know what jackson and russels characters do in quentin films.\n",
      "i give this movie 2 out of 5 on a watch it meter and if i had to some it up to one word it woud be lakin'g.\n",

      "i watched fast and furious 7 today with my children. i have to say what a brilliant tribute to paul walker. your end scene with vin came from the heart and i have even more respect for the team. that must have been so hard for you, it was amazing. paul's brothers done a brilliant job of helping to complete the film :)\n",
      "i think vin should get naked in the next one ;)\n",
      "i saw it last night (04/02/2015) and it was awsome! i was so impressed by the crazy stunt scenes. i love that combination of an adrenaline rush and a family story all rolled together, plus the added twists and turns and humor along with the music and sound i think made  this one the best one yet.i could see the love that was put into this one.  i also like how they brought in new characters-its cool to see veteran actors like kurt russell getting into the franchise. i was totally impressed.(plus  it didn't hurt that everyone of the men in the film is totally gorgeous! -that is always a plus).\n",

      "your the best vin :)\n",
      "super nice to hear that our comments actually affect you vin :d , but for my part, i am gonna say, fast and furious from after fourth installment, became more of an action series. its furious only. not fast. we wan the thuggy racing, back vin, :d that street dances, fights, and racing with nos on and the pay back. if there is more installments coming, make it both \"fast and furious\" :)\n",
      "i cried at the ending when they were on the beach and then started doing flash backs of paul. it was beautiful seeing all that. love the movies and own them all and will own the 7th one as soon at it comes out on dvd. i felt like i grew up watching paul and getting no no him personally on these movies. watching this amazing franchise has brought lots of laughter and pain from losing characters. i'm so sorry to you vin and everyone included in these movies that lost paul. he was amazing and it's going to be weird not seeing him in anymore movies but will still watch them if you guys make more. me and my husband named our middle son dominic after you in the movie and he thinks it's awesome cause he says you rock and wants to meet the person he's named after. can't wait for more movies to come. this last one was amazing. have a great day to you and yours. \n",

      "as much as i love the fast and furious series, i really think you should end with this movie. its just not the same without paul walker :( as much as the franchise drags in money, there has to be an end sometime?\n",
      "hey vin iight have another one for ya. by any chance are you familiar with sylvester stallone movies. one of which happens to be one of my favorites that he has done is called cobra. it's one of his best action movie that i think he has done. what i'm wondering is & i know he has worked with jason statham is that us there any possibility of getting stallone  in your fast & the furious series at all. as far as i gave seen in his movies he has always played the some sort of good guy in his movies in all that he has done weather it be his rocky movie series or judge dred or like i mentioned his cobra. i was maybe thinkin something along the lines of with jason in another series if you by any chance keep your series going. either way i'm still gonna keep watching your fast & the furious series cuz i think that they're the biggest hit going. also i hope you don't mind me saying is that i have been one of your biggest fans since day one & i'm really hoping that one day i get a chance to meet up with ya & just to be able to watch what you do in your movie makings or even to maybe experience it one day. anyway i wish you luck in your series. keep up the great work. paul will always be remembered.\n",
      "love the fast movies. love vin diesel(when he is not doing singing or dancing vids), i don't consider him b grade at all. i think fast 7 will be the last. they will just not be the same without paul walker. looking forward to watching it.\n",
      "fast & furiuos will never be the same without paul walker... i think jason statham doesn't fit in the movie, we don't like him in the movie... f&f is only for brothers brian (paul walker) & dominic (vin diesel)...\n",
      "the fast and furious movies are about friendship and love.  these things make the action more meaningful.  it's not just car chases, etc, it's about people taking care of each other.  i love riddick, too, and hope to see more!  other stuff, too, vin diesel!!!  there are plenty of us out here who can't get enough of you! <3 :)\n",
